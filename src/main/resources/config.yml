# Put Description Here that explains this
# plugin
#
# The Commands list is the list where you can add custom commands you want the plugin
# to run with the assigned wurd
# e.g - Banana wurd will "RunCmd" the command named 'WarnCommand'
#
# Adding a command is as simple as copying one of the already available commands and pasting
# it in the list followed by renaming it and changing the command it will run
# @player will be replaced with the player's name.
#
# The BadWurds list has prioritization, simply rearrange the words with their priority
# e.g - Banana comes first before Lag, so the plugin will check for Banana in the player's message
#       before Lag and so on..
#
# Flags:
#  ReplaceWith: 'NewWurdHere' - Replace the BadWurd with this wurd.
#  CancelMsg: boolean - Set True/False to cancel the chat message.
#  RunCmd: 'CommandHere' - Run Specified command from "Commands" list.
